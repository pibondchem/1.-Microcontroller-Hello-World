# Microcontroller-Hello-World

This is the first lab created for a General Physics class that incorporates the Arduino Uno and/or the Adafruit Metro Express micro-controllers.  

This exercise connects an LED display to the micro-controller and prints a short message.  Additional program files are available that can be added to demonstrate some of the other commands available to the LED drivers.  Two additional labs will be added soon.  An Ohmmeter is built in the second lab and a Capacitance meter in the third.

It is assumed that most of the students have no programming experience or experience with breadboarding.  

Notes:
1. The exercise was originally developed for the Arduino Uno, which is programmed in C++ with the Arduino IDE. 

2. The Adafruit Metro Express board was added more recently, and I am still tailoring the instructions for that board.  The Metro Express is programmed in Python with the MU editor available at https://codewith.mu.  
 
3. The programs provided for the two microcontrollers are similar, but not identical.  This is due to the amount of time I am willing to put into these programs.

4. If you download .tex files, you will also need the pics folder to compile the documents.

5. As the professor/lab director/etc. for the classes where the labs were used, I was always available to answer questions and help troubleshoot problems.  I have not added a lot of detail or clarification to these public handouts, so you may run into minor problems.  I assume that you are reading the documentation found on the Arduino or Adafruit websites -- this should help you navigate most issues.  You are welcome to email me with questions/problems, too.

6. Please let me know if you build any of these projects.
